# Final-The-Gas-Station-game
This was BEFORE my peer review
# the following is my technical documentation
# this is the technical documentation for Jordan's "The Gas Station" game
# this was written by Jordan on 3/18/2020
# the game code is hosted on both Github and Python Anywhere
# the game code is meant to build Jordan's coding skills and to provide user entertainment
# the game code was written in Python
# the ouput language is English only
# a user needs Python or Github or Python Anywhere in order to run the game program
# a computer needs some free memory space in order to run the game
# the game coding uses loops, functions, and conditional statements
# the variables are named accordingly and some variables are user inputs
# in order to run the game program, click on the "run" tab on the Python ribbon
# in order to re create the game code, the programmer needs to know about the basics of loops, functions, and conditional statements
# before the game program is deployed to the public, test, test, test! If there are issues, help me debug them please
# the game code is compartmentalized into 5 chapters. Each chapter is its own module. Within each module, there are a series of choices
# that the user can make. However, there are incorrect choices that will send you back to the beginning
# of the chapter or even the beginning of the game in one scenario. The decision choices
# are attached to if statements asking for user input
# press the run tab on the ribbon to start the game
